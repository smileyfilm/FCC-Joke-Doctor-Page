    <h3> Here's a timeline of Dr Jameson's progress: </h3> 
      <ul id="img-caption"> 
        <li><strong>May 21, 2020 - </strong>Dr Jameson officially announces that he believes he has a vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and that he plans to test the vaccine on several sheep in the coming weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>June 25, 2020 - </strong>Dr Jameson is interviewed by John Campbell and announces on live New Zealand television that his vaccine has shown to prevent contraction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in sheep, and that therefore "prevention in human beings is absolutely inevitable."</li>
        <li><strong>June 26, 2020 - </strong>At 11:58pm, William Harper-Winston, a special agent for the Illuminati, attempts to take Dr Jameson's life. Dr Jameson is shot fifteen times.</li>
        <li><strong>June 27, 2020 - </strong>Mortally wounded, Dr Jameson makes a phone call to his wife, Jaime Jameson. She arrives at the scene five minutes after Dr Jameson dies on the footpath. She injects Dr Jameson with something from a vial in her handbag, before lighting the vial on fire.</li>
        <li><strong>June 28, 2020 - </strong>Despite being pronounced dead first thing the previous day, Dr Jameson is revived. He reveals to the hospital staff, and to the police, that he had also found a cure for death during his experiments, but that he only planned to test it once on himself as it would be too risky to make its existence public knowledge. His wife had used it on him and destroyed what remained. He asks that his resurrection be kept a secret as the Illuminati will surely make another attempt on his life should they find out. </li>
        <li><strong>June 29, 2020 - </strong>After seeing Dr Jameson's results in his experiments with Cheshire sheep in the West Island of New Zealand, Doctor Ashley Bloomfield gives the green light on vaccinations throughout New Zealand, and the vaccine is secretly distributed to every home in New Zealand through NZ Post, so as not to alert the Illuminati.</li>
         <li><strong>July 10, 2020 - </strong>Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, reveals that every New Zealand home has been sent a vaccine and that New Zealanders are encouraged to use it on themselves and their offspring.</li>
        <li><strong>July 31, 2020 - </strong>New Zealand re-opens its borders to the rest of the world, knowing its citizens are safe from COVID-19 infection.</li>
        <li><strong>August 1, 2020 - </strong>Dr Jameson is murdered while on the phone during a media interview. </li>
    </ul>
